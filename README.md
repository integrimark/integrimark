# IntegriMark

IntegriMark is a sophisticated command-line tool designed for secure and traceable distribution of digital PDF documents. It primarily focuses on watermarking PDF files with unique, user-specific details, enhancing their traceability and deterring unauthorized sharing. The tool allows users to encrypt multiple PDF files, generating a secure _bundle directory containing the encrypted documents. Each file is associated with a unique, generated password, ensuring robust security. Additionally, IntegriMark facilitates the creation of customized URLs for each encrypted file, tailored to specific email addresses. This feature is particularly useful for controlled distribution, as it allows the tracking of document access through individualized links. The tool's functionality is further enriched by its ability to host the watermarked documents on a specified base URL, making it an ideal solution for distributing sensitive or proprietary information in a controlled and secure manner.
